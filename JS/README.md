# GPT-Bipartite (Prototyped in Javascript)

GPT-Partite consists of an NLP Encoder and an NLP Decoder. 

The NLP Encoder accepts streams of textual input and attempts to categorize the stream of tokens into hierarchical relationships, based upon new streams of text received during training. This catogrized data is then distilled into a well-structured data structure.

The NLP Decoder also accepts streams of textual input and attempts to categorize the stream of tokens into hierarchical relationships, using the filters generated by the NLP Encoder during training. This catogrized data is then distilled into a well-structured data structure and is then parsed against the existing data structure. If the structure can be parsed within the existing structure then theoretically a solution has been found, which is then formulated back into a well structured grammatical correct Natural Language response.

It is theorized the well-structured layout of the data structure inherently supports inference.
